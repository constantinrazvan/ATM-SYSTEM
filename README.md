# ATM-SYSTEM

After many searches of ideas for projects in C#, Udemy saved me and gave me this idea of an "ATM-SOFTWARE". So, this is my first program wrote in C#. This ATM Simulation is a simple project, done in like 30/45 minutes because I gave myself a challange: "What would I do if at work, the manager give me to work with a programming language that I didn't worked in before? I could work with it or I would give up?". So after a little bit of documentation of how to initiate a project, how to run the project and on W3School documentation about this programming language's syntax, data types and classes, I've managed to done this project. Hope you'll like it and be proud of me 'cause it's my first time on this language.  

My opinion about C# is that the language is not so hard to learn, it is like python at syntax(a little bit). I mean: 
## Python:
```
user_name = str(input("What's your name?") 
print(user_name)
```

## C#: 
```
Console.WriteLine("What is your name?"); 
var username = Convert.ToString(Console.ReadLine()); 
Console.WriteLine(username); 
```

It is good to learn and use if you are using a Windows OS because so you can do a lot more things, like Desktop Apps, Games with Windows Forms library, that others Operating System's can do with that language and you will not getting bored so quick of this programming language.
